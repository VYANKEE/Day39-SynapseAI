   ## 🚀 Project Overview

**Synapse AI** is a cutting-edge educational tool built during the **45 Days Coding Challenge (Day 39)**. It bridges the gap between raw information and structured knowledge. 

Unlike basic text generators, Synapse AI features a incorporating cinematic visual effects, physics-based interactions, and a seamless connection to **NVIDIA's Llama-3.1 70B** neural engine. It solves the problem of information overload by generating tailored notes (Short, Medium, Deep Dive) instantly.
